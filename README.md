# Combo Recovery #

Combo Recovery is an iOS app that is designed to help a user rediscover the combination of a MasterLock combination lock. The app is written in `Objective-C` and contains two separate methods for combination recovery. The first method was developed by Samy Kamkar ([samy.pl](https://samy.pl/master/master.html)) who reverse engineered a MasterLock combination lock and was able to develop a method to pare down the list of possible combinations to eight. The other method is the classical method of reduction which relies on finding the stick points of a combination lock and deriving a list of possible combinations from those stick points.
